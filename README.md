# ChartWatch Intermediate
This is a static site that consumes data from the Itunes top 100 charts RSS feed. It imports information from the current top 100 albums on Itunes and displays their covers, their titles, and the artists that made them. It's a front end application that utilizes Angular, alongside some animations using Sass. 

**A demo is available here:** https://bumpylumps.github.io/chartwatch-intermediate/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Angular, Sass, Typescript

Chartwatch Intermediate is a front end application that utilizes Angular and Typescript as a front end and Sass(.sass) for styles. It consumes data from the itunes top 100 rss feed which is supplied by the album.service in it's src/app directory.     

## Optimizations

Currently I'm working on adding more interactivity with the album items, and would like them to display more information when the user clicks on them. This would include release dates, prices from the Itunes store, alternative album covers, or even audio demos from the albums themselves.  

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first exposure to working with Typescript and Angular as an alternative to previous experience with React. I wanted to test my learning skills, and break out of my comfort zone code-wise. Getting more familiar with Typescript also helped me better understand strict typing and error handling with a compiled language. It also helped me better understand some of the quirks I had run into with Javascript and the silent errors it normally lets through when being parsed. Working with Angular helped me better understand front end frameworks in general, especially with some of the core concepts that are applicable across different ones (i.e. components with React). Finally, working with Sass was also a new experience for me, especially getting used to it's syntax and the way it's organized. I also really enjoyed learning how to utilize loops in Sass in order to make more interesting animations. I wanted to show that I can overcome obstacles when working with new technology that I was unfamiliar with, and learned alot about my own development style in the process. Typescript also helped me get better at googling errors, and Angular taught me how to use better context when sifting through documentation.
